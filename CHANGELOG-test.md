## ChangeLogs [Raghav] ##
###### * Imported the community cookbook [ntp] (https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/ntp "NTP Cookbook") ######
> NTP is a crucial service needed on every server, as it keeps the time on the server proper. This is very important for security, backup and in many cases for the proper functioning of mnay applications.
> This cookbook must be added to the base role, so that it is applied to all and any server started and configured with Chef
